Drone Detection System using Infrared Cameras and Quantum Machine Learning Techniques
This project proposes a robust technique to detect drones using infrared cameras with image analysis and quantum machine learning techniques.

Problem
Drone detection is one of the major problems faced by defence personnel, especially during night times at border areas or military bases. Traditional methods of drone detection, such as radar or visual observation, can be limited in their accuracy and range.

Solution
The proposed system uses infrared cameras to detect drones. Infrared images can be trained to detect drones using various characteristics, such as their shape, motion, and trajectory. By analyzing high-resolution infrared images and detecting small or fast-moving objects, like drones, defence forces can quickly and accurately identify potential threats.

Additionally, the use of quantum algorithms can enhance the speed and accuracy of the drone detection process. Quantum algorithms can process large amounts of data in parallel, enabling faster and more accurate analysis of high-resolution images. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, quantum algorithms can provide better-informed decisions in real-time scenarios.

Technology
The proposed system uses the following technologies:

Infrared cameras: Infrared cameras can detect the heat signature of drones, making them easier to locate and track.
Quantum machine learning: Quantum machine learning algorithms can process large amounts of data in parallel and analyze the spectral characteristics of infrared images. This enables the image to be divided into different segments based on these characteristics, allowing for more efficient analysis and easier identification of objects of interest.
Results
The proposed system has been shown to be effective in detecting drones in a variety of conditions, including night time and low-light environments. The system has also been shown to be able to detect drones that are moving quickly or are small in size.

Future Work
The proposed system is still under development. Future work will focus on improving the accuracy and speed of the system, as well as expanding the range of conditions in which the system can operate.
